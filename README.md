# Obeject_Oriented_Implementation_of_Snake_Game
This project aims to show the object-oriented implementation of a simple Snake Game and its overall object-oriented programming logic.
Each of the elements of this simple game has been programmed in an independent class which improves modularity and performance.
Hope you enjoy playing the game!!

For the sake of accurate functionality without error and warnings, it is highly recommended to run the code using PyCharm and on Windows.
